## hello! 

I'm Calvin. I code stuff in various languages such as PHP, Objective-C, Python, HTML, and Node.js. I know a bit of everything, but I'm trying to improve.

## what do you do?
whatever interests me at the moment. I'm currently trying to learn how to write tweaks for legacy iOS, and learning more about developing iOS apps.
